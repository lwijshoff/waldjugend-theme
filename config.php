 * Theme Configuration File

 * This file contains the theme-specific configuration settings. 
 * Currently, it simply assigns the tagline from the WordPress database 
 * to the `$horst` variable. The value of `THEME_TAGLINE` is fetched from
 * the database and can be used throughout the theme.
 *
 * To customize, modify the variables below as needed.
 * But please note that if you modify them in this file, they will get overwritten if you update the theme manually.
 * For a correct way form of updating the theme refer to https://github.com/lwijshoff/waldjugend-installation
