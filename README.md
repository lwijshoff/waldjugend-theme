## About

Waldjugend is a child theme of Nirvana, designed specifically for Waldjugend-based websites. It inherits the functionality and styling of the Nirvana theme, with custom modifications and enhancements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This README only contains information specific to this child theme. \
For complete details about the parent theme (**Nirvana** by **Cryout Creations**), including licensing, authorship, and bundled assets, please refer to the original documentation provided with the parent theme.

> [!TIP]
> This theme has been updated to work with an external [waldjugend-plugin](https://github.com/lwijshoff/waldjugend-plugin), which is not part of the original Nirvana theme. This plugin provides additional functionality and features that enhance the user experience on your Waldjugend-based website.
